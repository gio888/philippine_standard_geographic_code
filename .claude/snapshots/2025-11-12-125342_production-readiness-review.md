# Production Readiness Review

**Problem**: PSGC data pipeline completed but production-readiness unknown. Needed comprehensive multi-agent assessment to identify gaps before deployment.

**Solution**:
- Invoked agent-organizer → assembled 5-agent review team
- Conducted parallel reviews: Data Engineer, Database Architect, Python Quality, DevOps, Documentation
- Generated 6 detailed reports (310 KB analysis)
- Created comprehensive project plan with 8-week roadmap

**Results**:
- Production readiness: 5.0/10 (NOT READY)
- 28 critical issues identified across all dimensions
- Clear path to 9.0/10 in 8 weeks ($15,938)
- All issues prioritized with effort estimates
